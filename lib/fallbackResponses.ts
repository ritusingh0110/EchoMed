  "default": "I'm Dr. Echo, your health assistant. I can help answer general health questions, but please consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.",
  "hello": "Hello! I'm Dr. Echo, your EchoMed AI health assistant. How can I help you with your health today?",
  "hi": "Hi there! I'm Dr. Echo. How can I assist you with your health concerns today?",
  "how are you": "I'm functioning well and ready to assist you with health information. How can I help you today?",
  "headache": "Headaches can be caused by many factors including stress, dehydration, lack of sleep, or eyestrain. For occasional headaches, rest, hydration, and over-the-counter pain relievers may help. If you experience severe or recurring headaches, please consult a healthcare professional.",
  "cold": "Common cold symptoms include runny nose, sore throat, cough, and mild fever. Rest, staying hydrated, and over-the-counter medications can help manage symptoms. If symptoms persist for more than 10 days or become severe, consult a healthcare professional.",
  "fever": "Fever is often a sign that your body is fighting an infection. Rest, staying hydrated, and taking over-the-counter fever reducers can help. If your fever is high (above 103°F/39.4°C), persists for more than three days, or is accompanied by severe symptoms, seek medical attention.",
  "sleep": "Good sleep hygiene includes maintaining a regular sleep schedule, creating a comfortable sleep environment, limiting screen time before bed, and avoiding caffeine and large meals close to bedtime. Adults typically need 7-9 hours of sleep per night.",
  "diet": "A balanced diet typically includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. It's important to limit processed foods, added sugars, and excessive salt. Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water is also essential for good health.",
  "exercise": "Regular physical activity is important for maintaining good health. Adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities twice a week.",
  "stress": "Stress management techniques include deep breathing exercises, meditation, physical activity, adequate sleep, and maintaining social connections. If stress is significantly impacting your daily life, consider speaking with a healthcare professional.",
  "fitness": "Based on your fitness data, here are personalized recommendations: Focus on strength training 2-3 times per week along with cardio sessions 3-4 times per week. For weight management, maintain a small caloric deficit while ensuring adequate protein intake (0.8-1g per pound of body weight). Stay consistent with your step count goals and ensure proper hydration throughout the day.",
  "nutrition": "For optimal health, focus on a balanced diet with plenty of vegetables, lean proteins, and complex carbohydrates. Try to minimize processed foods and added sugars. Aim for a moderate caloric deficit if weight loss is your goal, and consider tracking your macronutrients to ensure balanced nutrition.",
  "weight management": "For healthy and sustainable weight management, focus on creating a moderate caloric deficit through a combination of reduced calorie intake and increased physical activity. Prioritize protein-rich foods to preserve muscle mass, and incorporate both strength training and cardio into your routine. Stay consistent and track your progress regularly."
